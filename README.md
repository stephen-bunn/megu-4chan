## Installation

With the latest version of `megu`, you should be able to install the plugin via `pip` using a command similar to the following:

```console
$ megu plugin install git+https://github.com/stephen-bunn/megu-4chan.git
Installing Plugin $HOME/.config/megu/plugins
...
```

Don't quote me on that though.
All of this is still heavily WIP.
